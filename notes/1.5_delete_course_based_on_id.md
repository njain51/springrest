Additonal code in FrontController for deletion by Id:
```text
 //deleting course
    @RequestMapping(path = "/courses/{courseId}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
    public ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> delCourse(@PathVariable int courseId) {

//        return this.courseService.delCourse(courseId);

        try {
            this.courseService.delCourse(courseId);
            return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.OK);


        }catch (Exception e){
            return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);

        }
    }

```

Additonal implementation method in service for deletion by id: 
```text
@Override
    public Course delCourse(int id) {
        Course c1 = null;
        for (Course c : list) {

            if (id == c.getId()) {
                c1=c;
                list.remove(c);
                break;
            }

        }

        return c1;
    }
```

Result:
```text
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/courses/124'

output:
{
    "id": 124,
    "title": "Java Corse",
    "desc": "This course is for Java aspirants"
}

```

```text
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/courses'
